# To build a simple keylogger in Rust, you would need to use the std::io and std::time modules. Here's an example of how it could be done:
# This program continuously checks for input from the keyboard every 10 milliseconds. If there is any input, it reads it and does nothing with it (this could be modified to handle the input in some way). The read(&mut [0]) call will block until there's something to read or an error occurs.

#Please note that this code requires user permission to access their keyboard events on most platforms, so running it might require additional steps depending on your system configuration.
