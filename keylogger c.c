#Creating a keylogger in C would typically involve hooking into the low-level event handling system provided by the operating system, which is not possible directly within standard ANSI C. However, you could create a simple script that launches another process and redirects its standard input to capture keystrokes:

#Please note that this is a very basic example and may not work perfectly with all software or hardware configurations. Additionally, running such a script could raise privacy concerns since it can capture all typed keys, including passwords or other sensitive information. Always ensure you have appropriate permissions and are using this tool responsibly!
