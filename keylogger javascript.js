#Here's an example of how to create a simple keyboard event listener (keylogger) using JavaScript:

#This script uses JavaScript's built-in addEventListener function to listen for keydown events on an input field with the ID "typedText". When a key is pressed, it logs the captured keystroke to the console and appends it to our global log string variable. If the user presses ENTER (key code 13), the script resets the log variable and focuses back on the input field for more typing.

#Please note that running such a script could raise privacy concerns since it can capture all typed keys, including passwords or other sensitive information. Always ensure you have appropriate permissions and are using this tool responsibly!
